# 🧠 QAT-Kit Clowder Manifest

> A “clowder” is a cohesive collection of cognitive tools, agents, pipelines, and integration logic that work together to augment reasoning, design, and development workflows — particularly those involving Codex, LLMs, or other AI agents.

---

## 📘 Overview

This clowder is designed as a modular, evolvable scaffold for building systems that collaborate with AI agents using natural language, guided reasoning, and structured memory artifacts.

It serves as both:

- 🧰 A working bundle of interoperable toolkits and agent behaviors
- 📐 A specification template for other developers to build their own cognitive clowders

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- **Natural-Language Native**: Optimized for Transformer LLMs and Codex. All schema, metadata, and control flows are human-readable and AI-inferable.
- **Cognitive Cadence-Aware**: Honors Run/Drift states, avoids mode confusion, maintains semantic thread continuity.
- **Intent-Preserving**: Captures human rationale across design stages via `.intent.md` and `.purpose.md`.
- **Composable by Default**: Tools, roles, and flows are designed for mix-and-match usage in future clowders.

---

## 🧠 LLM Alignment Model

This clowder assumes execution by Codex or equivalent LLM-based natural language engines.

### 🧠 LLM-Aware Design Rules

- **Flexible Semantics, Structured Anchors**: Templates allow inferred interpretation where possible, but flag “hard schema” fields that must not deviate.
- **Codex-Friendly Markdown**: All templates follow Markdown format with consistent metadata headers.
- **Reflection-Ready**: Tools include hooks for capturing reasoning, tradeoffs, and upstream intent drift.
- **Inference Tolerant**: Where field formats can be pattern-inferred or soft-matched, defaults and corrections are embedded.

## 📐 Template Contract Highlights

| Constraint Type     | Marking        | Description                                         |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Required field      | `@required`    | Must exist, LLM must not omit or hallucinate        |
| Optional field      | `@optional`    | Helpful but not enforced                            |
| Inferred field      | `@inferred`    | May be generated by Codex based on prior context    |
| Strict enum         | `@enum`        | Must match defined allowed values                   |
| No-fuzzing allowed  | `@locked`      | Field must not be rewritten or deviated from        |

(A full list will be defined in `template_field_modes.md`.)

## 🪞 Extension Notes

This clowder supports **Cognitive Forking** — where alternate branches of reasoning or architecture may be defined and evaluated in parallel.

Forks should be explicitly named (`fork.<label>`) and documented in the manifest.
