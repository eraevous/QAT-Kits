# Suggestions to fully activate CausalTraceNarrator inside agent ecosystem

1. Agent Trigger Prompt Generator

- A module that, given a new task, generates an internal prompt for Codex like:
- “Trace what happens from function X, narrate causality, and flag where this aligns with the user’s stated goal.”

2. Architectural Summary Store

- Output per-module summaries (via architecture_contextualizer) into vector or markdown notes for Codex to retrieve mid-task.

3. Chain-of-Thought Tracker

- Create a “breadcrumb trail” from Codex’s reasoning that can be audited or enhanced post-hoc.
