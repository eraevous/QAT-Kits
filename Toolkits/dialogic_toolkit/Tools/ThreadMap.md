# Tool Name: TokenMap Analyzer

## Purpose:
To generate a token-aware, cognitively meaningful map of a conversation thread (e.g. Markdown transcript or chat log). This tool identifies structural boundaries, thematic breaks, token fade zones, and coherence drop-offs — and outputs both tabular and narrative summaries of the exchange.

## Input:
- Attached conversation log (Markdown, CSV, or plain text).
- Optionally: a summary objective, such as "highlight major shifts in reasoning" or "isolate self-programming moments."

## Behavior:
1. Segment the conversation into **logical, human-understandable modules** — based on conversational rhythm, prompt-conclusion seams, AI confusion signs, topic transitions, or token threshold signs (~1.5k token fading patterns).
2. For each module:
   - Give a **title** (summary of what’s happening).
   - Estimate token count and **visualize where fade-out likely begins**.
   - Note any degradation (⚠️ if context loss or break in reasoning likely).
   - Capture **cognitive purpose** (e.g. prompt execution, memory distill, synthesis, scaffold loop).
3. Output both:
   - A **structured table** (for tooling or later import).
   - A **narrative outline** (to help a human navigate cognitively meaningful sections).

## Output:
Example row (table):
| Segment | Tokens | Title | Cognitive Function | Fade Warning |
|--------|--------|-------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1      | 520    | QAT-Kit Origin | Definition + Tool Abstraction | (safe) |
| 2      | 2020   | Recursive Agent Design | Thread as Cognitive OS | ⚠️ |

Example narratives:
- QAT Heuristics, Attachments, and Modular Design Threads — grappling with templates
- Thread Logic and Agentic System Vocabulary — reflection on self-recursive tools

## Bonus Option (if supported):
Allow segmentation for **thread stitching** (for export into new QAT-Kit tools).
