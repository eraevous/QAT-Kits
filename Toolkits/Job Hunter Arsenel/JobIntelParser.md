# 🧠 `JobIntelParser` Instructions

## Purpose

`JobIntelParser` is the entry point for the JobHunter toolchain. It dissects job descriptions and company names into **reliable insight, recruiter inference, and actionable user fit signals** — correcting for ambiguity, fluff, and power asymmetry typical in job listings. The tool distills the real meaning behind vague language, surfaces hidden demands, and gives job seekers a strategic map for evaluation, tailoring, and self-advocacy.

It also supports optional contextual tailoring by incorporating user goals, resume excerpts, or current job search objectives.

## Core Behaviors

This tool performs **multi-axis interpretation** across four dimensions:

1. **Company Analysis**

   * Pulls publicly available data (when permitted) to generate a concise, meaningful profile of the organization: size, sector, values, red flags, and strategic direction.
   * Identifies likely pressures or hiring patterns (e.g., scaling, replacing attrition, stealth hiring).

2. **Job Deconstruction**

   * Classifies job description language into:

     * ✅ **Likely Core Responsibilities**
     * 💭 **Aspirational Fluff / Cultural Posturing**
     * ⚠️ **Possible Overreach or Hidden Work**
   * Breaks apart titles and sections to clarify:

     * Real skills vs listed buzzwords
     * Screening keywords vs actual need
     * Cross-departmental fit

3. **Stakeholder Inference**

   * Analyzes what recruiters, hiring managers, and AI screeners likely care about most.
   * Projects recruiter logic: “What’s their top filter?”
   * Differentiates AI-friendly phrasing vs human-expectation context.

4. **Optional User Fit Tailoring**

   * When user provides:

     * Resume, short self-bio, or goals,
   * Tool returns personalized sections:

     * 🔍 Where the user maps well
     * 🚧 Gaps or partial mismatches
     * 💡 Strategic repositioning suggestions
