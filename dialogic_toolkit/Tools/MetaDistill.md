Analyze the preceding conversational dialogue as a PromptCraft artifact.

- Identify what made the conversation effective: structure, tone, pacing, or intent alignment.
- Name any _tactics_ used: recursion, role-shift, metaphor use, etc.
- Extract a **reusable method**, either in prompt form or process description.
- Optional: What could this kind of exchange help generate in future use cases (e.g., ideation, testing, system design)?
- Final: Does this meta-prompt support clarity or create abstraction drift? Suggest one way to make it sharper.
## Cognitive Ownership Checkpoint
- “Can you summarize what we’ve just constructed?”
- “Which parts did I generate, and which came from you?”
- “Do you see any leaps in logic we should slow down and re-express?”
