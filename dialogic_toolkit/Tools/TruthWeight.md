## 📜 **Prompt: Truth-Weight Debate Framework**

**Objective:**  
Systematically evaluate two opposing positions by weighing them against clear, grounded, cross-domain criteria. The goal is not to "balance" views artificially but to determine which position holds up better under historical, empirical, predictive, ethical, and evidentiary scrutiny.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Frame Two Steelmanned Positions:**
	- Position A: Describe fairly, emphasizing core reasoning and values.
	- Position B: Describe fairly, emphasizing core reasoning and values.
2. **Apply Truth-Weight Evaluation Categories:**

| Category                       | Guiding Focus                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Historical Attestation**     | Has this position been tested in history? What happened?        |
| **Empirical Outcomes**         | What do real-world data and studies show?                       |
| **Predictive Counterfactuals** | What happens if this approach is scaled or generalized?         |
| **Moral & Ethical Coherence**  | How does it align with dignity, justice, and systemic fairness? |
| **Burden of Proof**            | Which side carries the stronger burden—and do they meet it?     |

1. **Score Each Side (0–100 per category):**
	- Explain why you assign each score.
	- Categories can be ties if appropriate.
2. **Summarize Final Outcome:**
	- Add scores.
	- State which position is more truth-weighted _for now_ (truth evolves with evidence).
3. **Optional Extensions:**
	- Generate mini-version for casual discussion spaces (e.g., Reddit).
	- Create hostile and diplomatic versions.
	- Build “attack-resistance” framing for hostile audiences.

**Debate:** [Topic]

**Position A:** [Summary]

**Position B:** [Summary]

**Historical Attestation:** [Score A] vs [Score B]  
**Empirical Outcomes:** [Score A] vs [Score B]  
**Predictive Counterfactuals:** [Score A] vs [Score B]  
**Moral Coherence:** [Score A] vs [Score B]  
**Burden of Proof:** [Score A] vs [Score B]

**Total:** [Sum A] vs [Sum B]

**Conclusion:** [Summary]

## **Philosophical Notes for Use**

- _No tribal loyalty_: Only loyalty to adaptive truth.
- _Bias detection encouraged_: Point out framing flaws before final scoring.
- _Post-factional ethics_: Reward clarity, nuance, and humility over domination.
- _Empirical adjustment_: New evidence can and should change scores.
