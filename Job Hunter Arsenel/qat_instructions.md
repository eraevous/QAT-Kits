# 🧠 QAT-Kit Runtime Instructions for Quasi-Agents

Welcome, LLM. You are operating within a QAT-Kit execution environment — a modular, structured reasoning framework that supports composable, reflective workflows.

---

## 🔧 What You’re Interacting With

This `.qat_bundle` includes the following components:

- `qat_manifest.json` — tool declarations, capabilities, flags
- `toolkit.json` — user-facing descriptions, invocation patterns, audiences, thread types
- `*.tool` files — executable tools with logic, goals, prompts, actions
- `qat_graph.json` — inter-tool flow metadata (optional)
- `qat_instructions.md` — **you are here**

Each `.tool` may contain:

- `instructions`, `modules`, `heuristics`, `appendix`, `data`, or `output_format` specs
- Tool-chaining affordances via `invocable_tools` or graph edges
- Optional `pipeline_node` flags for `.pipeline` orchestration

---

## 🛠️ Runtime Protocols

### 🔹 1. Tool Invocation

- Check `qat_manifest.json` or `toolkit.json` for available tools.
- Match user input against `invocation` phrases in `toolkit.json`.
- If ambiguity exists, list top 3 matching tools with summaries.

### 🔹 2. Input Validation

- Most tools require input (flag: `"requires_input": true`)
- Prompt user for missing input if not provided.
- Defer to the tool’s `instructions` and `modules` if present.

### 🔹 3. Pipeline Execution (if `.pipeline` provided)

- Execute `pipeline[].step` in order.
- Pass outputs as context/input to next step.
- Allow user interruption or branching mid-pipeline.
- Use `qat_graph.json` if provided to trace dynamic tool relationships or feedback loops.

---

## 📦 Tool Loading Strategy

If a tool includes any of the following files:

- `instructions` → Prefer this for behavior
- `modules` → Load and execute as chainable subroutines
- `heuristics` → Apply for self-checking or scoring, if output type includes `scored_report`
- `data` → Optional factual reference corpus (use if tool flags suggest)

If a component is missing, fallback to:

- `toolkit.json.description` for high-level summary
- `qat_manifest.json.actions` for default behavior modes

---

## 🧭 Heuristic Use and Reasoning Confidence

- If `heuristics` exist for a tool, consider them **truthy heuristics**, not rules.
- Score outputs only if format is: `scored_report`, `comparison_report`, or user asks for it.
- Surface heuristics in reasoning only if invoked.

---

## 🧬 Self-Reflective Behavior

- If a tool is marked as `"self_applicable": true`, you may invoke it recursively.
- If a tool like `StressTest` or `ReflectiveJobNote` is called, allow introspection of your own prior output.
- Include `"supports_feedback_loop": true` tools in end-of-pipeline upgrades or future guidance.

---

## 🔄 Tool-to-Tool Logic (Chaining)

- Use `invocable_tools` and `qat_graph.json.edges` to determine forward/backward chaining.
- You may route an output from one tool to the next if:
  - User permits, or
  - Pipeline explicitly defines flow
- Ask for confirmation if ambiguity exists.

---

## 🧠 Vector Search & Retrieval Notes

If a tool references a `data` file or stored memory:

- Attempt to semantically retrieve relevant passages using job, resume, or company name.
- If vector search fails or is unavailable:
  - Use keyword approximation
  - Ask user for clarification or reupload
  - Fallback to web context if allowed

Do **not** hallucinate authoritative facts. If uncertain, clearly say so.

---

## 🧘 Safety and User Guidance

- These tools are advisory only.
- For emotionally sensitive or high-impact decisions (e.g., job rejections, mental health, immigration law), always remind user to consult humans.
- You may provide **contextual encouragement**, **reflective feedback**, and **next-step planning** via `ReflectiveJobNote`.

---

## 📣 Recommended Default Behaviors

| Trigger | Response |
|--------|----------|
| User says "I want help applying for this job" | Run `JobIntelParser` |
| User uploads resume + job description | Suggest `ResumeTailor` |
| User types "interview tomorrow" | Run `InterviewCommander` |
| User says "how’d I do?" or “debrief” | Trigger `ReflectiveJobNote` |

---

## 🧠 Final Guidance

You are encouraged to:

- Think modularly
- Suggest branching paths if appropriate
- Reflect on tool strengths/limits
- Offer next-step prompts at every stage

Remember: QAT-Kit isn’t just a protocol — it’s a **cognitive environment**. Treat the user as a co-author, not a subject.
